		  All other modules/packages could read DNI global configs from this file.
		  It's a run time file, so it should be used during DUT running.

		  During compiling, will write all CONFIG_DGC_*** to this file, and modules
		  could load feactures dynamically depends on contents of this file.

		  Value must be an absolute path!!!

	config DGC_WAN_IF_NONUSE_BRIDGE
		bool "WAN interface don't use bridge"
		default n
		help
		  Current QCA don't support hardware acceleration on bridge interfae.
		  As Netgear required, just use physical Ethernet interface as WAN
		  on PPPoE connection, and disables IPTV/VLAN too in this case.

		  Once QCA upgrade SDK to support hardware acceleration on bridge,
		  we can undefine this config.
